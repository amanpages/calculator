# calculator
* In this I have made a JavaScript calculator.
* The boxes are arranged in center and there is hovering effect on boxes when hovered.
* Here the selection operation for dropdown will only occus when both the numbers are given input in the boxes.
* The result will be calculated on that basis and when any of the number is changed the result gets updated as per the change.
* There will a message of can not divide by zero when number gets divided by zero.
